<h2>About</h2>
<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I will be finishing my Bachelors of Science in Information Technology this year, and am currently seeking employment in Front-End Web Development.</p>

<p>My current goal is to become a full-stack MEAN developer, or work within a similar stack. I have a strong propensity for quick learning, and am very willing to adapt to the technological needs of the company I am given the privilege of working for.<p>

<p>I have a well-rounded set of skills, with a specialization in Single-Page Application architecture. I am knowledgeable in Angular, TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I have additional experience with Git, Git BASH, NPM, and the Wordpress CMS.</p>

<p>Outside of the realm of web development, I have a large amount of work-related experience using Active Directory, Powershell, SysAid, Exchange Administration Center, and multiple features of the Remote Server Administration Tools package. I am most familiar with the PeopleSoft ERP.</p>

<p>Alongside the realm of Information Technology, I have extensive experience within the realm of Audio Engineering, with experience writing, mixing, and mastering music, as well as creating compositions for video projects and developing unique sounds via synthesis. If your project or company produces multimedia, I would be happy to provide services in this area as well as within IT.

<p>The world of IT is constantly evolving, and I understand the importance of keeping up with the latest and greatest in developer tools and security flaws. I feel that I am an ideal candidate for any company that wants someone who is willing to learn new important functions of a system, and wants to ensure that their IT department is future-proof.</p>
